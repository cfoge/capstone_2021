# Description
This project aims to document the creation of a hardware video processing tool through the
implementation of a two-channel digital input video mixer with an overlay based around the Arty Z7:
APSoC Zynq-7000 (utilising the Zynq-7000 SoC).

### The specific aims of this project are to:
● Mix two digital video sources in real-time using an FPGA (one DVI/HDMI input, one internally
generated)
● Perform simple aesthetic effects or transformations to the video output
● Control mixing and effects via an interface (physical or digital)
